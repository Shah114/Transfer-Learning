# Transfer-Learning
Fine-Tuning

**Introduction** <br/>
Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model, developed for a particular task, is reused as the starting point for a model on a new task. This approach leverages the knowledge gained from a source task and applies it to a related target task. Transfer Learning is particularly useful when the target task has limited labeled data, allowing models to achieve better performance by building on previously acquired knowledge. <br/>

**Why Use Transfer Learning?** <br/>
1. Reduced Training Time: By starting with a pre-trained model, the training process is significantly faster since the model already has learned general features from a large dataset.
2. Improved Performance: Pre-trained models have been trained on vast datasets and can capture complex patterns. Fine-tuning these models often leads to better performance on related tasks.
3. Less Data Required: Transfer Learning is beneficial when you have limited data available for the target task. The pre-trained model can generalize better with fewer samples. <br/>
