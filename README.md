# Transfer-Learning
Fine-Tuning

**Introduction** <br/>
Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model, developed for a particular task, is reused as the starting point for a model on a new task. This approach leverages the knowledge gained from a source task and applies it to a related target task. Transfer Learning is particularly useful when the target task has limited labeled data, allowing models to achieve better performance by building on previously acquired knowledge. <br/>
<br/>

**Why Use Transfer Learning?** <br/>
1. Reduced Training Time: By starting with a pre-trained model, the training process is significantly faster since the model already has learned general features from a large dataset.
2. Improved Performance: Pre-trained models have been trained on vast datasets and can capture complex patterns. Fine-tuning these models often leads to better performance on related tasks.
3. Less Data Required: Transfer Learning is beneficial when you have limited data available for the target task. The pre-trained model can generalize better with fewer samples. <br/>

**How Does Transfer Learning Work?** <br/>
1. Pre-training: A model is first trained on a large, diverse dataset for a specific task. For instance, a neural network can be trained on ImageNet, a large dataset of images, to recognize general image features.
2. Transfer: The pre-trained model's weights and architecture are transferred to a new model tailored for the target task. Depending on the similarity between the source and target tasks, different levels of the model can be reused:
* Feature Extraction: Only the model's base layers are used to extract features, while the top layers are replaced and retrained for the target task.
* Fine-Tuning: The entire pre-trained model is used, but the last few layers are retrained or fine-tuned with a smaller learning rate to adjust to the new task.
3. Target Task Training: The transferred model is trained on the target task's data. This training can involve fine-tuning the pre-trained layers and training new layers added for the specific task. <br/>
