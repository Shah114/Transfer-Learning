**Introduction** <br/>
Transfer Learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model, developed for a particular task, is reused as the starting point for a model on a new task. This approach leverages the knowledge gained from a source task and applies it to a related target task. Transfer Learning is particularly useful when the target task has limited labeled data, allowing models to achieve better performance by building on previously acquired knowledge. <br/>
